A quick and easy utility to make good looking UI in Unity. I created this project to make it easier to make good looking UI. In the end I was able to add 3 new custom Unity windows. Through this proccess of making this addon to Unity I learned a lot about taking my time.
Through the process of making this project I gave myself the challenge of not using any form of AI, whether it was resarch or when I was stuck and needed help. So instead I did my own resarch, and in the end I learned a lot more this way. Before I only really used AI when I was stuck,
but when I completly removed it from my workstyle for this week I noticed I learned a lot more and faster. Even though I spent a lot more time than I would have used AI, I think it was worth it.

# SnapUI

## SnapUI View:
This window gives a view of only the UI. The current features of this window are: Moving objects around with automatic snapping, Resizing the UI elements in the screen, switching between different UI canvases, different sized grids, and functionality for changing different viewing sizes.

## SnapUI Hierarchy:
This window is very similar to the default Hierarchy, but with one major difference. It separates between the different UI canvases, but if you would like to stick with the default hierarchy that is fine, my custom inspector(I'll talk more about it in a minute) works fine with the normal hierarchy too.

## SnapUI Inspector:
This is my favorite part about this addon for Unity. It is where all of the heavy lifting comes in play. This window can: edit the theme files I have custom created for this project, update the UI of the objects without the scene to be running, support for buttons, a full area of tools for editing text,
creating templates of items you have allready made so you can easily drop another into the scene, alignment tools for the position of the selected UI object, and a debug view to see the size and pos relitive to its parent.
